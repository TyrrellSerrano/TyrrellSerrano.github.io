        <!-- <p>Consider the function of time as related to a place. How does it relate to memory? How does memory relate to the senses (visual, audio)?</p> -->
        <p>Im no scientist but, I heard time moves differently in space. Something like time moves slower the closer you are to a massive object or a black hole, I don't really remember. Typically people can only remember so much, and we tend to forget things the more time has passed since the event & remember what happened most recently the best. Things that register as an extreme to our senses are often remembered in full, regardless of when they were experenced.</p>
