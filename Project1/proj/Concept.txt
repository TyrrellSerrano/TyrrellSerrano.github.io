My target audience are students (pre-college).
 I hope to convey information about the government buildings of stamford (over time).
I'd like the website to be visually apealing and not cluttered. since some of the pictures are old (and lower quality),
 ill need to focus on the layout and color choice to make digesting the information easy on the eyes.
