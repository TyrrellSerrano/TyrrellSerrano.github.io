Only did Native American trails existed. The first order of business was the construction of a Meeting House. The First Meeting House was a small, rough wooden structure of four post construction. Each Post was approximately 12 feet in height except for the center post - it was to around 30 feet in height." <br /><br />
            The placement of this first structire was on a little hill between two swamps. It was chosen as an ideal spot for their Meeting house, because it could be fortified to serve as a fort and was near an established Indian trail. It stood in what is now called Veterans Park, next to Atlantic Street, across from the "Old Town Hall." The interior Structure was uncomfortable; rough benches served as pews and there was no protection from the cold during the harsh New England winters."
