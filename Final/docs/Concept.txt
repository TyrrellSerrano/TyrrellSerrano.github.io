My Target audience is Fighting game players (FGC - Fighting Game Community members), particularly those who play Dragonball FighterZ.
The goal is to both provide Information about the game (at a competitive level) as well as be a platform for others to post information.
The Website will be organised first by game title then by gameplay elements.
A strong focus on easy navigation & easy to read information will be implamented.
