A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/ekubli/pen/grFon.

 A little web app I'm making (and improving) in my free time to help mock up the look of adding custom art and button colors to arcade sticks.

Originally forked from http://codepen.io/mattjstrauss/pen/gkDpe, but I changed the look of the buttons and felt that I had diverged enough from the original to make this my own pen.
