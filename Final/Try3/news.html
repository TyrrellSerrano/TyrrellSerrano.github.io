    <p>ELEAGUE is continuing their Mortal Kombat 11 Showdown event with a new weekly series, the organization announced this morning.

<p>This live streaming competition will see prominent members of the community diving into NetherRealm Studios' newly released fighting title with the goal of scoring as many wins as possible within a four-hour period each time. Competitors will aim to climb the leaderboards, and there will be cash prizes on the line. </p>

<p>The ELEAGUE Mortal Kombat 11 Showdown will come in the form of a 13-week competition that will begin on Wednesday,
May 1, at 5 p.m. EDT / 2 p.m. PDT on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/eleaguetv">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.eleague.com/">ELEAGUE.com</a>. We'll be seeing live episodes up through Wednesday, July 24, and David "UltraDavid" Graham and Ryan "Mr. Aquaman" Kablik will return to commentate various matches across the players' live streams. </p> 

<p>If you want to keep track of several competitors at one time, ELEAGUE has you covered. The organization has also announced the launch of their "Multi-Viewer Experience" feature that allows fans to "seamlessly switch between any of the influencers’ Twitch channels at any time during the weekly live Showdown competitions."</p> 

<p>This interface will be available on ELEAGUE.com, and if you opt to use it you will be able to jump from the ELEAGUETV channel to any Showdown competitor stream with virtually no latency, according to the press release, and bring your multi-stream viewing experience all to one screen. </p> 


<p>The ELEAGUE Mortal Kombat 11 Showdown sees competitors battle for wins against online opponents to earn points. In the <a href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2019/mar/30/eleagues-mortal-kombat-11-beta-showdown-live-stream-featuring-honeybee-unrooolie-dragon-killer-xinok-scar-reo-and-more/">initial, one-day Shodown event</a>, each win earned players one point. They also scored five bonus points for winning a match with each of the Mortal Kombat 11 beta's five characters — as the event took place during the game's pre-order beta test period. </p>

<p>Previously, the players who were brought in to join the Showdown were BC|HoneyBee, Big D, Llumiya, Unrooolie, tru3ta1ent, Dragon, Killer Xinok, END|Scar, Mym Alkapone, Reo, PND|Ketchup and PND|Mustard. Though we have yet to see the list of competitors for the new weekly series, there's a chance that some of these players may return and other prominent figures, like FOX|SonicFox, might also be asked to join. </p>

<h1>That E. Honda Street Fighter 5 teaser trailer going around is fake, folks</h1>

<h2 class="sub_headline">I mean, it's pretty obvious, but it's worth saying</h2>       
    
    
    
    
        <p class="center">
        <img src="https://media.eventhubs.com/images/2019/04/29-e-honda-street-fighter-5-teaser-trailer-going-around-fake-folks.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" border="0">
        </p>
     
    <p>You've probably seen or heard of a new Street Fighter 5 trailer going around right now that teases a new character coming to the game in Season 4. E. Honda is supposedly making his return, according to this <em>totally</em> real and <em>not at all fake</em> video. 
    
    
                
                    </p><div id="abcddim2abcd">
                    <script data-cfasync="false" type="text/javascript"> 
                    var element  = document.getElementById('abcddim2abcd')
                                
                    if (element.offsetWidth || element.offsetHeight || element.getClientRects().length){
                      var newdiv = document.createElement("div");
                      newdiv.id = 'EventHubs_300x250_300x600_ATF';
                      element.appendChild(newdiv);   
                      freestar.queue.push(function () { googletag.display('EventHubs_300x250_300x600_ATF'); });
                      console.log('mr mobile');
                    }        
                    </script>
                    </div>
               
        
      <p></p> 

<p>Well, I hate to be the one to break this to you, but that E. Honda teaser trailer is bogus. There are several obvious reasons pointing to this video's lack of authenticity, so allow me to shed some light on them. </p> 
	  
	
	
      


<p>In the teaser, we see the ESRB rating pop up, followed by the logos for PlayStation and Capcom — like we'd see in an official trailer. We then see what looks to be an updated version of E. Honda's bathhouse stage, followed by the classic sumo wrestler himself. </p> 

<p>Immediately, those who've played Street Fighter 4 (or have ever seen it) can tell you that the Honda here is pulled right out of that game complete with his intro. E. Honda himself does look a little different, sporting some facial hair and tattoos, but there's an easy explanation for everything here. </p> 

<p>Everything we see in this supposed teaser trailer is a result of PC mods. This further proves that the trailer is not official as Capcom would likely never use PC mods to advertise their own products, even if it were a joke. In fact, Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/RilesBarkley_KC/status/1122638472148180992">RilesBarkley_KC</a> shared the exact video from which this E. Honda intro clip was pulled. </p> 

<p><em>IF</em> that wasn't enough to tip you off, the big "X" that gets pasted over Honda's face in the trailer and the message over it are a dead giveaway. The Japanese text reads "E. Honda is not coming," and you can hear the crowd's laughter when the message appears on screen. </p> 

<p>The teaser seems to have been shown at the end of a tournament in Japan and was captured by audience member <a href="https://twitter.com/sakaguchi_game/status/1122548638004039680">sakaguchi_game</a>. Based on the trailer itself, it was likely that whoever put it together was just aiming to have a little fun and not actually mislead people, but I think that some people are so starved for new Street Fighter 5 info right now that any murmur of anything is enough to get them talking.</p> 

<p>Check out the fake trailer below and let us know how much you want E. Honda in Street Fighter 5 in the comments. </p>
